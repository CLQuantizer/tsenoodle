# Tsenoodle

An AI-powered menu helper for Tse's restaurant near the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

## What is this?

Tse himself opened this restaurant, and sometimes people aren't sure what to order. This simple web app helps you choose what to eat using AI - just tell it what you like or what you're in the mood for, and it'll suggest something from the menu.
